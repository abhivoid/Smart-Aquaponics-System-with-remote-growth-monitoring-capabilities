# Smart Aquaponics System with remote growth monitoring capabilities
Aquaponics, the combined cultivation of fish and plants in a recirculating system, offers a promising approach to sustainable food production.This project has the potential to revolutionize aquaponics, fostering a more sustainable and productive future of food production. By optimizing growth conditions through smart automation and computer vision, the system can lead to increased yields and reduced resource waste. This translates to more food production with less water and fertilizer usage, contributing to a more efficient and environmentally friendly agricultural system. Its key innovations include:
1. Remote Automation with Combined Data Transfer 
2. Computer Vision for Plant Health Assessment
3. Network Setup and Data Transfer
4. Data-Driven Insights and User-Friendly Interaction
